# ETH 2.0 PySpec

The Python executable spec is built from the ETH 2.0 specification, 
 complemented with the necessary helper functions for hashing, BLS, and more.

With this executable spec,
 test-generators can easily create test-vectors for client implementations,
 and the spec itself can be verified to be consistent and coherent, through sanity tests implemented with pytest.

Contributions are welcome, but consider implementing your idea as part of the spec itself first.
The pyspec is not a replacement.
If you see opportunity to include any of the `utils/` code in the spec,
 please submit an issue or PR.

## License

Same as the spec itself, see LICENSE file in spec repository root.
