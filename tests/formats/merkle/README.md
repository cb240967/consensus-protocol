# Merkle tests

This series of tests provides reference test vectors for validating correct
generation and verification of merkle proofs based on static data.

Handlers:
- `single_proof`: see [Single leaf proof test format](./single_proof.md)
- Different types of merkle proofs may be supported in the future.
